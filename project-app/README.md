As reported by [SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/) (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) global military spending has continued to [increase](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2019-04/fs_1904_milex_2018_0.pdf). Since the war on terror began at the outset of the 21st century, several questions remain. Given the increase in military spending, has global terror been decreasing in its intensity or getting more severe? Have arms deals with non-state groups increased, and have these deals affected the rate of terror attacks? How has the nature of terror changed, the targets, and nations involved? Additionally, recent arms buildup can give us information on areas of rising tensions. This data is significant due its ability to further elucidate problems regarding the state of global security today, and possibly point us to trends into the future. It is possible that the nature of military spending today is in response to other threats on the horizon and the war on terror is waning, but the opposite may also be true. Before we proceed it may be useful to familirize yourself with some fo the major terrorist groups that have been active in the past few years.

Our first main data set is a database file detailing all terrorist acts that have occured since 1970, for the purpose of this project we have selected only terrorist attacks occuring after 2000. This data set contains a rich variety of information on these attacks, such as deatailing the weapon used, target, and location.

This data set originates from the [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/) compiled by a research consortium called [START](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Consortium_for_the_Study_of_Terrorism_and_Responses_to_Terrorism). START is located at the University of Maryland and is funded by the Department of Homeland Security. Their methodology includes using AI as well as Human researchers to compile this data.

This dataset details the value of weapons both imported and exported from all countries in the world since 1950, but for the sake of our project, we will only be using data since 2000. The data set additionally lists all arms transfers to non-state groups, which includes terrorist groups.

The Global Arms Transfers data was compiled by [SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/) (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute), which has been collected data on the arms trade and conflict for 50 years. The SIPRI institute is funded by the Swedish Government and counts around 60 academic researchers among its ranks. The World Bank also uses this data to track arms shipments
